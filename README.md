PRAVETZ-8D Plus Project

An 8-bit home computer using a home TV instead of a monitor. 
Programmatically incompatible with Pravets 82 family computers (due to the different architecture). 
An analogue of Oric Atmos. At first, it only works with a tape recorder (after 1990, floppy drives 
for it also appeared, united in one housing with the controller[3]. 
It has improved sound capabilities, through a Yamaha microcircuit. It is widely used for home use 
and for training The extremely attractive price of the model (about 10 times lower than Pravets 82) 
gives high hopes for this model and not a few students have taken their first steps on Pravets 8D.
