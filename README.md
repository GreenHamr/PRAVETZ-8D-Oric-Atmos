PRAVETZ-8D Plus Project

An 8-bit home computer using a home TV instead of a monitor. 
Programmatically incompatible with Pravets 82 family computers (due to the different architecture). 
An analogue of Oric Atmos. At first, it only works with a tape recorder (after 1990, floppy drives 
for it also appeared, united in one housing with the controller[3]. 
It has improved sound capabilities, through a Yamaha microcircuit. It is widely used for home use 
and for training The extremely attractive price of the model (about 10 times lower than Pravets 82) 
gives high hopes for this model and not a few students have taken their first steps on Pravets 8D.

That's what happened to me. My first personal computer was a Pravetz-8D (Oric Atmos).

About a year ago I remembered my old childhood friend and wondered if I could make one of these.
Of course, first I called my mother to ask her if my old computer was still lying in a basement in my old house. To my great surprise, I found out that she had put it in a briefcase along with a pack of floppy disks.
A little battered and missing a single key, but - WORKING.
Unfortunately, the floppy disk drive and the controller were not preserved.
